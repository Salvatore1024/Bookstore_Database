## 1. Project name:
Bookstore Database

## 2. Description:
For this project, I created a program that allows the user to generate and manage a database where to store books. 
The user can interact with it through operations of creation, reading, updating, and deletion of books. Each book stored 
into the database and displayed is based on 4 main selectors: ID-Title-Author-Quantity.

## 3. Contents:
**ebookstore.py** - This file contains the whole program. It allows the user to interact with the database through inputs.

## 4. Installation:
To run and use this program is necessary to install a recent version of Python that can be found at https://www.python.org/downloads/.

## 5. Usage:
Open and run the file ebookstore.py. Follow the instructions displayed on the console and navigate through the menu to discover all the possible options. 
In case of an empty database, the program will repopulate it with sample records.<br>
Following you can find a screenshot that shows how the program should run:<br><br>

**- Be sure to have on your machine a recent and correctly working version of Python.**

## 6. Credits:
This program was created by me, during the **DfE Skills Bootcamp** provided by **HyperionDev** (https://www.hyperiondev.com/).
